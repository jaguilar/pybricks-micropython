 * Implementation of local continuations based on switch() statement
 *
 * This implementation of local continuations uses the C switch()
 * statement to resume execution of a function somewhere inside the
 * function's body. The implementation is based on the fact that
 * switch() statements are able to jump directly into the bodies of
 * control structures such as if() or while() statements.
 *
 * This implementation borrows heavily from Simon Tatham's coroutines
 * implementation in C:
 * http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The code in this file stems from Contiki's implementation of protothreads as
 * listed above. This adaptation changes the API to work better with Pybricks.
 *
 * Caution: it is conceptually very similar to Contiki but it cannot be used as
 * a drop-in replacement.
